Heatmap for in vivo mouse behavior and duration (time spent) calculations for different modes of experiment

Program code file for Figures (and relevant Supplementary Figures) in the manuscript of interest.  

There are three types of python codes that process on-off-on stimulation data, social experiment data (type 1 - empty vs mouse; type 2 - mouse 1 and mouse 2). These Python codes require the user to load processed Ethovision data (Movement tracking by Ethovision software, and then subsequent processing of mouse coordinates to produce a csv file. This python code uses that csv file to calculate time spent values and produce heatmap or the density plot. 

Note that the raw data from must be edited into a relevant csv file.
